POCKET_PHP is a MVC implementation for PHP web projects that emphasizes simplicity and speed.
PHP inherently lacks a proper MVC arquitecture implementation which has become standard for
web development, this has slowly steered developers towards alternatives that lack
PHP's speed and extremely simple configuration.

POCKET_PHP serves as a starting template, it validates the client's
request, encapsulates all the relevant data and sends it to the respective controller file. It also
provides a working example of a login system that can be easily enhanced to serve whatever
your project may need. A simple yet fast template engine helps controllers build an HTML
repsonse by tag replacement that allows a complete separation between logic and presentation.
The code base is short and readable, it provides the full cookie cutter MVC design in an efficient
and adaptable way through PHP.

Some of POCKET_PHP's features are:

- Full MVC implentation
- HTML template engine
- Login system
- HTTP request manager
- Request tracking and IP banning
- Example website project included
- Scalable and easily modifiable
- Self documented, its that simple
- MIT Licensed
    
* Installation

1. Install PHP7 and NGINX

I recommend installing both through your package manager, if your using a debian based distro simply:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php7.2 php7.2-fpm php7.2-sqlite php7.2-curl nginx
#+END_SRC

2. Clone the POCKET_PHP reporistory and set the server permissions

#+BEGIN_SRC 
git clone https://gitlab.com/Alex-HG/pocket_php
mv -r pocket_php /var/www/html/
sudo chown -R username:www-data /var/www/html/pocket_php
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/pocket_php
#+END_SRC

3. Configure NGINX

Remember to modify the provided nginx virtual server configuration file to match your desired settings!

#+BEGIN_SRC 
sudo mv /var/www/html/pocket_php/static/text_files/nginx_config /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

sudo systemctl restart php7.x-fpm.service
sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
#+END_SRC

4. Configure POCKET_PHP

All the relevant configuration lies in app/configure.php, note that the core directory holds the sqlite database file and thus both the file and folder must be writeable by the web server.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
sudo chown -R username:www-data /var/www/html/pocket_php/core/
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/pocket_php/app/core/pocket_php.db
#+END_SRC

* Included Example website and documentation

By default, POCKET_PHP comes with an example site that, thanks to its tiny code base, serves as its main documentation.

#+html: <p align="center"><img src="app/static/images/exampleSite.png" /></p>

Seeing the "user guide" section for a more thorough explanation.

* Planned Features 
The current plan is to add support for REST APIs and a proper account creation. Even though such additions will inevitably require
changes by the developer, most of the code is ultimately the same.
