# POCKET_PHP CONFIGURATION FOR NGINX
# Pocket_PHP requires a straightforward setup to work:
# 1. Serve static files directly
# 2. Redirect everything else to /app/index.php
#
# This keeps everything within the /app/ directory available to the webserver
# while preventing the direct execution of PHP scripts.
# The NGINX configuration includes filters to cache static files and limit access
# to certain formats. The best way to secure files, however, is to place them outside
# the root directory specified below, NGINX won't serve them directlyy but php-fpm
# (being its own process) can as long as its running as a user / group with the
# correct permissions. Hidden files are also denied.
#
# Make sure to add the server_name redirect to /etc/hosts !
